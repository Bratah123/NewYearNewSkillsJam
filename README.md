# NewYearNewSkillsJam
Team Singularity's Game for New Year New Skills Game Jam on itch.io.

# Overcropped
The game takes place on a humble little farm. Where our main character (Name to be decided) is looking to strike it big into the farming industry. Currently our little hero has no real life connections related to the industry, and is hoping that selling crops at cheap to multiple companies could help with that! Play the game as you frantically try to deliver the correct crops to the comapanies and try to gain new companions and new connections as you build your farming empire.
